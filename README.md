# Compound Interest Calculator

A calculator that lets the user see the amount of money he will accumulate over time based on an initial balance, interest, time period, and future deposits.
The user can choose between a yearly and monthly interest rate, whether they want their compound interval to be monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, and how often their deposits are gonna be, with the same four options available as the compound interval.

The data is displayed in a table, and the user can select whether they want to see it displayed in months or years.
